## Have any Questions about Avatar Creation?
Check out the linked [Common Creator FAQ](https://github.com/NotAKidOnSteam/AASEmulator/wiki/Common-Creator-FAQ) wiki page for some general good-to-know information before fully diving into ChilloutVR Avatar Creation. Some things mentioned there aren't properly documented elsewhere.

Feel free to join the Alpha Blend Interactive [Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/abi) to get help from other community members!
The `#-general-avatars` & `#-advanced-settings` channels would be most appropriate for Avatar-related questions.

Some utility functions as well as the main inspiration for the "Emulator" part & structure. Not much is applicable to ChilloutVR or its CCK.
